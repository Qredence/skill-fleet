# API Schemas (reference)

Last updated: 2026-01-27

This file points to the canonical schema definitions used by the API.

Primary locations:

- Auto-generated OpenAPI / Pydantic models: `src/skill_fleet/api/schemas/`
- Human-readable schema reference: `docs/api/V2_SCHEMAS.md`

If you need to modify request/response models, edit the Pydantic models under `src/skill_fleet/api/schemas/` and run the tests.
