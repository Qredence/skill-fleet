The `python-testing` skill is designed to be the "Verify" stage in a "Plan-Code-Verify" agentic loop. When an agent generates code, it should immediately invoke the `test_discovery` and `test_runners` capabilities. If the runner returns a non-zero exit code, the `failure_analyzer` should be used to format the error log before passing it back to the code generation skill for correction.

Furthermore, this skill integrates with `execution_environment` by assuming a pre-configured Python interpreter is available in the shell. For CI/CD workflows, it should be composed with `git` (to identify changed files) and `coverage_analysis` (to block merges that decrease total code coverage). Use the `references/pytest-patterns.md` to ensure generated tests follow project-specific idioms.
