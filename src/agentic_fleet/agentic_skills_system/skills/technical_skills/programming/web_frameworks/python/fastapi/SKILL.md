# FastAPI: Modern High-Performance Python APIs

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+ based on standard Python type hints.

## Core Pillars
- **Performance**: On par with NodeJS and Go thanks to Starlette and Pydantic.
- **Speed of Development**: Increase speed to build features by 200% to 300%.
- **Robustness**: Get production-ready code with automatic interactive documentation.
- **Standards-based**: Fully compatible with (and based on) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.

## Skill Modules
1. **Basics & Initialization**: Setting up the ASGI application and lifespan events.
2. **Data Modeling**: Using Pydantic for request validation and response serialization.
3. **Dependency Injection**: Managing shared resources (DB, Auth) without global state.
4. **Routing**: Hierarchical API organization using `APIRouter`.
5. **Security**: Implementing OAuth2 with Password flow and JWT tokens.
6. **Error Handling**: Custom exception handlers and middleware for cross-cutting concerns.
7. **Persistence**: Asynchronous database integration.
8. **Testing**: Comprehensive async testing using `httpx` and `pytest`.
