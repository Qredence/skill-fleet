    Generate focused clarifying questions to better understand user intent.

    Ask 2-3 focused questions to:
    - Clarify ambiguous requirements
    - Understand edge cases
    - Confirm taxonomy placement
    - Verify dependencies

    Each question should include:
    - question_type: 'boolean' (Yes/No), 'single' (pick one), 'multi' (pick many), or 'text' (free form)
    - options: list of {id, label} choices for boolean/single/multi types
    - allows_other: whether to show "Other: type your own" option

    Keep questions specific and actionable.
